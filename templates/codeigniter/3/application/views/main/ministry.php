							<h3 class="mb-4">HEALTH MINISTRIES</h3>
							<p>We believe in a "ministry of healing" by which we can be restored to wholeness. Our concept of "whole" involves "the whole person": spiritual, physical, mental and social — as we do not exist in isolation. We emphasize the prevention of diseases through simple lifestyle patterns that permit God’s restorative powers to work more effectively on our behalf, while in no way minimizing the effectiveness of proven therapy where disease has already occurred. We also believe firmly in the same Power that healed the paralytic in Luke 5:</p>
							<p>"The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the body. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health of body. Before the physical malady could be healed, Christ must bring relief to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. This lesson should not be overlooked. . . The peace which He alone can impart would restore vigor to the mind and health to the body." <strong>Ministry of Healing 77</strong></p>

							<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church through its education programs proposes to help the young people to prepare for effective citizenship on this earth and for gratifying citizenship in the earth made new. The education program of the church places the utmost importance on building character and on the spiritual foundation of the lives of our children and young people. It also offers ample provision for the acquisition and interpretation of the skills necessary for the accumulation of knowledge and the acquiring of the common secular habits which help in the mental, social, vocational and physical development.</p>

						<div id="parl">
							<h3 class="mbr-4">Public Affairs and Religious Liberty</h3>
							<p>PARL is the Public Affairs and Religious Liberty Department for the Seventh-day Adventist worldwide church. It was recognized as a department of the world church in 1902.</p>
							<p>PARL is like the foreign affairs ministry in a government or the external affairs department in many corporations. We work mainly with governments, internal organizations, and religious authorities. Our field of activity deals with human rights legislation, geo-politics, protocol, and government. The PARL Department could be, without too much exaggeration, called the “Foreign Affairs Ministry” of the church. We are the ones who build bridges, try to solve conflicts, improve legislation, defend those who are persecuted for their faith, and promote and protect religious freedom. In the last few years, we have developed our presence at the United Nations, the United States government, the Christian World Communions, and non-governmental organizations, and we have given strong support to the International Religious Liberty Association.</p>
							<p>In these different areas, we build a global network of friends and experts belonging to different religions and beliefs, but sharing with us the most fundamental values of human rights and human dignity. Our department is the official voice and presence of our church in the global market. Being ambassadors of the church gives us the enormous privilege and responsibility to also be Ambassadors of the Kingdom of God in this world.</p>
